## Installation

```
npm install graphology-communities-louvain
```

## Usage

Runs the Louvain algorithm to detect communities in the given graph. It works both for undirected & directed graph by using the relevant modularity computations.

This function also works on multi graphs but won't work with mixed graph as it is not trivial to adapt modularity to this case. As such, if you need to process a true mixed graph (this function will correctly handle mixed graphs containing only directed or undirected edges), cast your graph as either directed or undirected using [graphology-operators](/standard-library/operators) dedicated functions.

Note also that this algorithm's run time is bounded by the number of edges in your graph. As such, it might be preferable, in some cases, to cast your multi graph as a simple one using [graphology-operators](/standard-library/operators) functions for better performance.

Note that the community labels are returned as an integer range from 0 to n.

```js
import louvain from 'graphology-communities-louvain';

// To retrieve the partition
const communities = louvain(graph);

// To directly assign communities as a node attribute
louvain.assign(graph);

// If you need to pass custom options
louvain.assign(graph, {
  resolution: 0.8
});

// If you want to return some details about the algorithm's execution
var details = louvain.detailed(graph);

// If you want to ignore your graph's weights
louvain.assign(graph, {getEdgeWeight: null});
```

_Arguments_

- **graph** _Graph_: target graph.
- **options** <span class="code">?object</span>: options:
  - **getEdgeWeight** <span class="code">?string\|function</span> <span class="default">weight</span>: name of the edges' weight attribute or getter function.
  - **nodeCommunityAttribute** <span class="code">?string</span> <span class="default">community</span>: name of the community attribute.
  - **fastLocalMoves** <span class="code">?boolean</span> <span class="default">true</span>: whether to use a well-known optimization relying on a queue set to traverse the graph more efficiently.
  - **randomWalk** <span class="code">?boolean</span> <span class="default">true</span>: whether to traverse the graph randomly.
  - **resolution** <span class="code">?number</span> <span class="default">1</span>: resolution parameter. An increased resolution should produce more communities.
  - **rng** <span class="code">?function</span> <span class="default">Math.random</span>: RNG function to use for `randomWalk`. Useful if you need to seed your rng using, for instance, [seedrandom](https://www.npmjs.com/package/seedrandom).

_Detailed Output_

- **communities** <span class="default">object</span>: partition of the graph.
- **count** <span class="default">number</span>: number of communities in the partition.
- **deltaComputations** <span class="default">number</span>: number of delta computations that were run to produce the partition.
- **dendrogram** <span class="default">array</span>: array of partitions.
- **modularity** <span class="default">number</span>: final modularity of the graph given the found partition.
- **moves** <span class="default">array</span>: array of array of number of moves if `fastLocalMoves` was false or array of number of moves if `fastLocalMoves` was true.
- **nodesVisited** <span class="default">number</span>: number of times nodes were visited.
